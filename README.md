Cloud Connector Sample Application
==================================

This example demonstrates the usage of the Cloud Connector API. Users can manage
the connection status of the service as well as configure several of its 
parameters. It is also possible to receive device requests from Remote Manager
and upload any type of data point.

Demo requirements
-----------------

To run this example you need:

* One compatible device to host the application.
* A USB connection between the device and the host PC in order to transfer and
  launch the application.

Demo setup
----------

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. The device is powered on.
2. The device is connected directly to the PC by the micro USB cable.

Demo run
--------

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is to build and launch 
the project.

Once application starts, configure the basic Cloud Connector service parameters
such as device name, description, contact information and vendor ID. The rest of
parameters are configured by default. Click save to store the new values.

Device requests can be received from Remote Manager using the target name 
"cloud_connector_sample".

Finally, you can send any type of data point to Remote Manager by clicking on 
"Data Points" button. In the new dialog configure the desired data point format 
and number and click "Send" button.
